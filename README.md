# :wave: Welcome! I'm Alex Molina.

Yeh I know, my name is kind of regular yet I'm not an average developer.

As a fan of e-learning, FOSS, and the evolution of Internet, such a mix couldn't produce something rather than a web developer I think; one who loves bringing great user interfaces to life that run clean, efficient code under the hood. That's a profile I've been sharpening for 8 years :muscle: by working on projects for clients all around the globe :earth_americas: from WordPress sites to custom e-commerce applications. 

### _"Wait, how's that not average?"_

Well, I've been in charge of the wireframing, UX/UI design, development, deployment and maintenance for most of those projects, delivering the final product and assessment in a timely manner without many changes or any cultural friction (I not only speak English, Spanish and Portuguese, but also am probably the most open-minded person you'd talk to). All that just boosts my skills and sales :sunglasses:

## Nobody's perfect though

I'm a perfectionist, quite competitive, and constantly looking for ways to do the exact same work, but better :sweat_smile: and that can be annoying for some (if not for you tho, check my contact links below :point_down:). Another of my cons is that I'm so professional that I'm not the right person for debating on politics or cult films at work, tho I can provide advice regarding the software instead, without criticizing the client or any ideas of them. That's also why people perceive my development and software architecture operations "a bit too objective" :pencil: but we can try making business if you don't mind all that (again, links below).

The tools I work with the most on a daily basis:

My motto is to work on projects that are compatible with the LARC philosophy (Love, Art, Revolution and Care), which are the ones that in my opinion can help humankind and the planet as a whole. Thanks for willing to know me better, I invite you to check out the projects I've built on my portfolio and, if you're interested in working with me, feel free to drop some lines thru either my personal website, my email, or social media links:
