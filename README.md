:wave: Welcome to my profile! I'm a web designer and developer from Latin America.

- I'm Alex Molina, a huge fan of global Internet innovation and open-source software, who has been working with web technologies and languages for the last 5 years. I've worked for several clients all around the world at web development and UX/UI design positions :computer: :triangular_ruler: enjoying the whole process and sharing life experiences with people from different backgrounds. I also love working on personal and cooperative projects to give back to the World the knowledge and experiences that have had a big influence on me. :muscle:

- Iâ€™m interested in improving my skills and being up-to-date, for this reason I work and constantly learn new things with the MERN, MEVN and LAMP stacks. Some projects and tools I love and use besides these are PUG, Tailwind, Shoelace CSS, Vite.js and SQLite. I am not a perfectionist but I do consider myself a very disciplined and organized person so I'm quite caring about best practices, performance, methodologies and of course the work philosophies of the teams I've worked with.

The tools I work with the most on a daily basis:
