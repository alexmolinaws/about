:wave: Welcome to my profile! I'm a professional web designer and developer from Latin America.

I'm Alex, a huge fan of global Internet innovation and open-source software, who has been working with web technologies and languages for the last 5 years. I've worked for several clients all around the world at web development and UX/UI design roles :computer: :triangular_ruler: enjoying the process and sharing experiences with people from different backgrounds. I also love working on personal and cooperative projects to give back to the World the knowledge and resources that have had a big influence on me. :muscle:

The tools I work with the most on a daily basis:  

![Linux](https://img.shields.io/badge/Linux-FCC624?style=for-the-badge&logo=linux&logoColor=black) ![Firefox](https://img.shields.io/badge/Firefox-FF7139?style=for-the-badge&logo=Firefox-Browser&logoColor=white) ![Figma](https://img.shields.io/badge/figma-%23F24E1E.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=figma&logoColor=white) ![Git](https://img.shields.io/badge/git-%23F05033.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=git&logoColor=white) ![Mega.nz](https://img.shields.io/badge/Mega-%23D90007.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=Mega&logoColor=white) ![Inkscape](https://img.shields.io/badge/Inkscape-e0e0e0?style=for-the-badge&logo=inkscape&logoColor=080A13) ![Visual Studio Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Visual%20Studio%20Code-0078d7.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=visual-studio-code&logoColor=white)  

Iâ€™m interested in improving my skills and being up-to-date, for this reason I work and (constantly) learn new things using the LAMP and MERN stacks. Some projects and tools I love and use besides the core ones of those are PUG, Tailwind CSS, Shoelace CSS, Vite.js and SQLite. I am not a perfectionist but I do consider myself a very disciplined and organized person so I'm always quite caring about best practices, performance, methodologies and of course the team philosophies of the organizations I've worked with.

Languages and stacks I develop apps with:  

![Apache](https://img.shields.io/badge/apache-%23D42029.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=apache&logoColor=white) ![HTML5](https://img.shields.io/badge/html5-%23E34F26.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=html5&logoColor=white) ![CSS3](https://img.shields.io/badge/css3-%231572B6.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=css3&logoColor=white) ![PHP](https://img.shields.io/badge/php-%23777BB4.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=php&logoColor=white) ![MySQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/mysql-4479A1.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=mysql&logoColor=white) ![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/javascript-%23323330.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=%23F7DF1E) ![NodeJS](https://img.shields.io/badge/node.js-6DA55F?style=for-the-badge&logo=node.js&logoColor=white) ![MongoDB](https://img.shields.io/badge/MongoDB-%234ea94b.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=mongodb&logoColor=white)  

My motto is to work on projects that are compatible with the LARC philosophy (Love, Art, Revolution and Care), which are the ones that in my opinion can help humankind and the planet as a whole. Thanks for willing to know me better, I invite you to check out the projects I've built on my portfolio and, if you're interested in working with me, feel free to drop some lines thru either my personal website, my email, or social media links:
